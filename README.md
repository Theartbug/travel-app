Objective
===

Create a page that demonstrates use of responsive raster image strategies and vector images. Use principles of responsive typography and make page scan-friendly. Use vanilla JS webpack component architecture. Use CSS grid and flexbox. Use semantic markup.

Steps Taken
===

Set up the component architecture. Create an about principles page and splash entry page. Set an event listener on the splash page that will redirect user to about page and show the header and footer. Use a mixture of flexbox and grid to create resposive, scannable layouts. Create multiple (10!) images of the splash page image for different screen sizes and resolutions. Use media queries to apply these responsive changes.

Reflection / Changes
===

This was my first time trying to manually create responsive images that change depending on screen size and resolution. It is very tedious work, and I can't imaging having to do this manually for more than a couple images at a time! I used a website to resize and crop images (http://resizeimage.net/). SVG images are credited to Wick (http://jameswickham.com/10-symbols/).
